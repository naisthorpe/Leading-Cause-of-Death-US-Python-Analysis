# Leading-Cause-of-Death-US-Python-Analysis

This project is my attempt to play around with a dataset for my General Assembly Python final project. I wasn't in the best frame of mind when I picked this dataset, and it was a struggle to really think of what I wanted to look at and pick out from the dataset. 

With that said, I put a focus on looking at my home state of North Carolina as well as a couple of causes of death that are important to me. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer this year, so looking at cancer death trends seemed to be an interesting route to take. I also looked at Alzheimer's disease briefly since it runs in my family.

I found the csv file at the following link: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-leading-causes/index.htm#data-tables
